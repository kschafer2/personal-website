            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <img src="kyle-schafer.jpg" alt="Kyle Schafer">
            <p>I was born and raised in Lee's Summit, Missouri as the second son of Steven and Suzanne Schafer. As a young child, I attended Hazel Grove Elementary and enjoyed my evenings drawing and playing basketball in the backyard with my older brother, Brian. After elementary school, my family and I moved to the other side of town, where I dove into the world of computer games and computer hardware. I built my first computer during middle school and continued building computers and gaming throughout high school. 
            </p>
            <p>Full of curiosity and thirsty for knowledge, I studied kinesiology at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas for one year. After deciding to attend college closer to home, I transferred to the University of Missouri, Columbia where my interests continued to broaden. Rock climbing became a staple of my lifestyle, and my love for science resulted in the acquisition of B.A. in Biology and B.S. in Psychology.
            </p>
            <p>Ultimately, these degrees did not satisfy my cravings for learning and technology, so I decided to formally continue my education of computers at Columbia College. I am excited to graduate with a B.S. in Computer Science and continue to hone my software development skills and technical knowledge in the workforce.
