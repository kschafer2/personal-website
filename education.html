            <h3>Education</h3>
            <p>My education in Lee's Summit, Missouri started at Hazel Grove Elementary, took me to Bernard C. Campbell Middle School, and ended at Lee's Summit North High School. I then traveled to the desert of Nevada and furthered my education at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas for one year. I returned closer to home and graduated from the University of Missouri, Columbia with degrees in biology and psychology. Now, I am finishing my degree in computer science at Columbia College of Missouri and will have graduated at the end of April, 2019.
